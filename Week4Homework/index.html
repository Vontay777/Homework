            Keiichi at a early age developed a love for "drifting" despite his lack of wealth to fund his passion, he dedicated himself to touge running in the 1970s, grabbing the attention of fellow hashiriya.
            The snow-covered bends of the Japanese mountain roads gave Keiichi plenty of opportunity to hone what were to become his unique racing skills.

          <h2> The "Drift King" is Crowned </h2>
          <p2>
            As an ambitious street racer pulling moves that nobody had seen before, Keiichi quickly gathered an underground following. When he became a pro' racer, he took his oversteer slide on to the track, injecting more excitement for racing spectators.
            Although his freshman licence was suspended for his sensational but illegal moves, he'd introduced drifting to official racing, giving the sport legitimacy. For this, Keiichi was crowned the 'Drift King'.
            It is rumored that the character Takumi from the hit Japanese Anime 'Initial D' was based around Keiichi.
